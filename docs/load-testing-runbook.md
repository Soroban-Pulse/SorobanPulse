---

## Running Scenarios Locally

```bash
# 1. Start the service (in another terminal)
cargo run

# 2. Run any scenario
k6 run tests/load/events.js
k6 run tests/load/sse_stream.js
k6 run tests/load/stress.js
k6 run tests/load/spike.js
k6 run tests/load/multi_contract.js
k6 run tests/load/webhook_delivery.js

# Short soak (validation run — override default 24 h)
k6 run -e SOAK_DURATION=30m tests/load/soak.js

# Point at a non-default host or inject an API key
k6 run -e BASE_URL=http://staging.example.com -e API_KEY=mykey tests/load/stress.js

# Save a JSON summary for regression check / archiving
mkdir -p tests/load/results
k6 run --out json=tests/load/results/stress_raw.json tests/load/stress.js
```

### Environment variables accepted by all scenarios

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | Service base URL |
| `API_KEY` | — | Sent as `X-Api-Key` when set |
| `SOAK_DURATION` | `24h` | Soak test duration (`soak.js` only) |
| `CONTRACT_IDS` | built-in stubs | Comma-separated real contract IDs (`multi_contract.js`) |
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | — | Admin key for replay endpoint (`webhook_delivery.js`) |
| `WEBHOOK_RECEIVER` | — | Stub receiver URL to poll (`webhook_delivery.js`) |

---

## Historical Data Management

Use `scripts/perf_regression.sh` to archive, purge, and inspect historical results.

### Archive a result

```bash
# Archive a k6 JSON summary into tests/load/results/history/<scenario>/
scripts/perf_regression.sh archive events_steady \
  tests/load/results/events_steady_raw.json 1M
```

This creates a dated file such as:
```
tests/load/results/history/events_steady/20260729T120000Z_1M.json
```
and appends a line to `tests/load/results/history/index.jsonl`.

### Purge old results

```bash
# Remove result files older than the default retention (90 days)
scripts/perf_regression.sh purge

# Custom retention period
scripts/perf_regression.sh purge --days 30
```

The `RETENTION_DAYS` environment variable sets the default:

```bash
RETENTION_DAYS=60 scripts/perf_regression.sh purge
```

---

## Regression Detection

After any run, compare against the baseline library:

```bash
# node tests/load/regression_check.js <scenario> <summary.json> [baselines.json] [db_size]
node tests/load/regression_check.js events_steady \
  tests/load/results/events_steady_raw.json \
  tests/load/baselines.json \
  1M
```

Or via the shell helper:

```bash
scripts/perf_regression.sh check events_steady \
  tests/load/results/events_steady_raw.json 1M
```

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | All checks passed — no regressions |
| `1` | One or more regressions detected |
| `2` | Bad arguments or missing file |

**Regression thresholds** (configured in `tests/load/baselines.json`):

| Dimension | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Latency (any percentile) | > 20 % above baseline |
| Error rate | > 2 percentage points above baseline |
| Memory growth (soak) | > 50 % above baseline |

Both passing and regressing runs are appended to the `history` array in `baselines.json` (capped at 200 entries) for audit purposes.

---

## Trend Analysis

Use `tests/load/analyze_results.js` to inspect trends across multiple runs.

### Show a trend table

```bash
# Last 10 runs for multi_contract scenario
node tests/load/analyze_results.js trend multi_contract

# Filter by database size, show last 5 runs
node tests/load/analyze_results.js trend stress --last 5 --db-size 1M
```

The trend subcommand reads the index at `tests/load/results/history/index.jsonl` (or falls back to scanning files directly). It prints a table of all tracked metrics across the selected runs plus an overall trend arrow:

```
=== TREND: events_steady — last 5 runs ===

  Metric                 20260720T...  20260721T...  20260722T...  ...
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  p50 latency              8.2 ms        8.1 ms        8.3 ms   ...
  p95 latency             24.1 ms       23.8 ms       25.0 ms   ...
  p99 latency             44.6 ms       43.9 ms       46.2 ms   ...
  error rate             0.000 %       0.000 %       0.000 %   ...
  throughput              100           100           100       ...

  Overall trend (p50 latency): → STABLE (+1.2 % over 5 runs)
```

### Summary of a single file

```bash
node tests/load/analyze_results.js summary \
  tests/load/results/stress_raw.json --scenario stress
```

### Side-by-side comparison

```bash
node tests/load/analyze_results.js compare \
  tests/load/results/history/stress/20260701T000000Z_1M.json \
  tests/load/results/stress_raw.json \
  --scenario stress
```

Delta column shows percentage change with warning symbols (⚠ > 10 %, ✗ > 20 %, ✓ improved).

---

## Baseline Promotion

When a deliberate performance improvement lowers latency, update the baselines to avoid false positives on future runs.

### Promote via the analysis tool

```bash
# 1. Run the scenario and confirm the improvement is intentional
k6 run --out json=tests/load/results/events_raw.json tests/load/events.js

# 2. Promote the new numbers to baselines.json
node tests/load/analyze_results.js promote events_steady \
  tests/load/results/events_raw.json 1M

# Or via the shell helper:
scripts/perf_regression.sh promote events_steady \
  tests/load/results/events_raw.json 1M
```

### Promote manually

Edit `tests/load/baselines.json` directly. Update the relevant `p50_ms`, `p95_ms`, `p99_ms`, and `error_rate` fields under `scenarios.<name>.baselines.<db_size>`.

### Committing a baseline change

```bash
git add tests/load/baselines.json
git commit -m "perf(load): update events_steady baseline after index optimisation"
```

Never update baselines to cover up a regression — fix the regression first.

---

## CI/CD Integration

The workflow `.github/workflows/load-tests.yml` runs load tests automatically.

### Trigger matrix

| Job | On PR | On push to main | Weekly | Manual |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `load-events-steady` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `load-multi-contract` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `load-stress` | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `load-spike` | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `load-soak` | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `load-test-summary` (PR comment) | ✓ | — | — | — |

### Manual trigger

```
GitHub → Actions → "Load Tests" → Run workflow
```

Inputs:

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `scenario` | (all) | Run a specific scenario only |
| `db_size` | `1M` | Baseline row to compare against |
| `soak_duration` | `30m` | Override soak duration (e.g. `24h` for full run) |

### Artifacts

Each job uploads results to GitHub Actions artifacts (retained 30 days; soak retained 90 days). Download them for offline analysis:

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh run download <run-id> --name results-stress
```

### PR comment

When `load-events-steady` and `load-multi-contract` both complete on a PR, the `load-test-summary` job posts a comment with key p99 latency and error rate values.

---

## Interpreting Results

### Steady-State (`events_steady`)

**SLO:** p99 < 200 ms, error rate < 1 % at 100 req/s.

A regression here usually means:
- A new database migration added an unindexed column to the query path
- The connection pool is undersized for the test runner

Check `soroban_pulse_db_pool_size / soroban_pulse_db_pool_max` in Prometheus. If consistently near 1.0, increase `DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS`.

### Stress Test

Look for the **breaking point** — the request rate at which p99 exceeds 1 000 ms or error rate exceeds 5 %.

Expected degradation pattern:
```
200 req/s  → p99 ~80 ms   (normal)
400 req/s  → p99 ~150 ms  (some queuing)
600 req/s  → p99 ~300 ms  (pool contention)
800 req/s  → p99 ~800 ms  (saturation)
1000 req/s → p99 ~1500 ms (overloaded)
```

The **recovery** phase (last 2 min) must show p99 returning to within 20 % of the pre-stress baseline. A slow recovery indicates:
- Connection pool not draining (increase `DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` or reduce `DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS`)
- Memory pressure causing GC pauses (check `soroban_pulse_process_memory_bytes`)

### Spike Test

Three phases appear in the output:

1. **Pre-spike baseline** — should match `events_steady` numbers.
2. **Spike** — p99 may reach several seconds; error rate may briefly exceed 10 %. Rate-limiting (429s) is acceptable and counted separately.
3. **Recovery** — p99 must drop below 200 ms within the 2-minute recovery window.

If recovery is slow, the connection pool is the first suspect. A 10× burst drains idle connections; they take time to be returned or the pool needs to warm up again.

### Soak Test

Compare `p95_ms_hour1` vs `p95_ms_hour12` vs `p95_ms_hour24`.

More than 10 % increase over 24 hours indicates latency drift, typically caused by:

| Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Gradual memory growth | Memory leak | Profile with `soroban_pulse_process_memory_bytes` |
| Table bloat | High write rate, autovacuum lagging | `VACUUM ANALYZE events;` |
| Index fragmentation | Hot-row updates | `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_ledger;` |
| Connection pool saturation | SSE connections not returning slots | Audit SSE connection lifecycle |

### Multi-Contract Queries

Per-query-type p99 values make it easy to isolate regressions:

| High metric | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `mc_contract_latency_ms` | Missing or bloated `idx_events_contract_id` |
| `mc_filter_latency_ms` | Missing composite index on `(event_type, ledger)` |
| `mc_pagination_latency_ms` | Deep OFFSET inefficiency (consider cursor-based pagination) |
| `mc_ndjson_latency_ms` | Serialisation bottleneck or large payload |
| `mc_tx_latency_ms` | Missing `idx_events_tx_hash` or index bloat |

### Webhook Delivery

The webhook test drives the admin replay endpoint and observes `soroban_pulse_webhook_failures_total` via `/metrics`.

A rising failure counter during the test indicates:
- Webhook receiver is rate-limiting or timing out
- Retry queue is saturated

Check `soroban_pulse_webhook_failures_total` in the Grafana dashboard.

---

## Performance Budgets

| Scenario | p99 budget | Error budget |
|---|---|---|
| Steady-state (100 req/s) | 200 ms | 1 % |
| Stress peak (1 000 req/s) | 2 000 ms | 5 % |
| Spike burst (10× for 30 s) | 5 000 ms | 10 % |
| Recovery (post-spike) | 200 ms | 1 % |
| Soak (24 h) | 500 ms | 1 % |
| Multi-contract queries | 400 ms | 1 % |
| Webhook delivery | 1 000 ms | 5 % |

These budgets are enforced as CI gates. A job that exceeds a budget exits with code 1 and blocks the merge.

---

## Updating Baselines

Baselines are stored in `tests/load/baselines.json` per scenario and per database size (`100k`, `1M`, `10M` events).

**When to update:**
- After a deliberate performance improvement
- After a capacity change (larger instance, more DB connections)
- After an intentional architectural change that shifts expected numbers

**Never update baselines to hide a regression.** Fix the regression, verify the fix, then promote.

**Procedure:**

```bash
# 1. Confirm the new numbers with a full test run
k6 run --out json=tests/load/results/multi_contract_raw.json \
  tests/load/multi_contract.js

# 2. Review the numbers
node tests/load/analyze_results.js summary \
  tests/load/results/multi_contract_raw.json --scenario multi_contract

# 3. Promote to baselines
node tests/load/analyze_results.js promote multi_contract \
  tests/load/results/multi_contract_raw.json 1M

# 4. Commit
git add tests/load/baselines.json
git commit -m "perf(load): update multi_contract baseline — composite index added"
```

---

## Webhook Delivery Setup

`webhook_delivery.js` needs a real or stubbed webhook receiver plus admin credentials.

### Option 1: WireMock stub

```bash
# Start WireMock
docker run -p 8080:8080 wiremock/wiremock --global-response-templating

# Register a catch-all mapping
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/__admin/mappings \
  -d '{"request":{"method":"POST","urlPattern":"/.*"},"response":{"status":200}}'

# Run the load test
k6 run \
  -e ADMIN_API_KEY=your-admin-key \
  -e WEBHOOK_RECEIVER=http://localhost:8080/webhook \
  tests/load/webhook_delivery.js
```

### Option 2: webhook.site

```bash
# 1. Visit https://webhook.site and copy your unique URL
export WEBHOOK_URL="https://webhook.site/<your-uuid>"

# 2. Start the service with the webhook configured
WEBHOOK_URL=$WEBHOOK_URL WEBHOOK_SECRET=test-secret cargo run

# 3. Run the test
k6 run \
  -e ADMIN_API_KEY=your-admin-key \
  -e WEBHOOK_RECEIVER=$WEBHOOK_URL \
  tests/load/webhook_delivery.js
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### k6 "connection refused"

The service is not running or is listening on a different port.

```bash
# Verify service health
curl http://localhost:3000/healthz/ready

# Override BASE_URL
k6 run -e BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 tests/load/events.js
```

### "VUs failed to be initialized" errors in k6

The `preAllocatedVUs` count is too low for the test runner machine. k6 will use `maxVUs` as the cap; this warning is informational and does not affect results.

### regression_check.js exits 2 with "metric not found"

The k6 JSON summary does not contain the expected metric. This usually means:
- The summary was produced by a different scenario than the one passed to `regression_check.js`
- k6 did not run long enough to emit any samples

Pass the correct `--scenario` flag and ensure the test completed at least one iteration.

### Soak test killed by CI timeout

GitHub-hosted runners have a 6-hour job limit. Use a self-hosted runner for full 24-hour soaks, or override `soak_duration` to a shorter interval:

```yaml
# In the workflow_dispatch inputs
soak_duration: 6h
```

### analyze_results.js trend shows no data

The `index.jsonl` file is missing or does not contain entries for the requested scenario. Archive at least one run first:

```bash
scripts/perf_regression.sh archive events_steady \
  tests/load/results/events_steady_raw.json 1M
```

### Memory growth in soak test exceeds threshold

1. Check `soroban_pulse_process_memory_bytes` in Prometheus over the soak window.
2. If RSS grows linearly with time, run a flamegraph against a live instance:
   ```bash
   cargo flamegraph --bin soroban-pulse
   ```
3. Common culprits: unbounded broadcast channel receiver list, leaking SSE connections, growing in-memory query cache with no eviction.
