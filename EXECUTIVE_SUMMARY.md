# Webhook Delivery Reliability & Observability - Executive Summary

## Problem Statement

SorobanPulse's webhook delivery system lacks comprehensive monitoring and operator visibility, creating blind spots for production incident response. Critical gaps include:

1. **No real-time observability** — Operators cannot see webhook endpoint health or delivery latency
2. **DLQ chaos** — Dead-letter queue grows without analysis or easy recovery mechanisms
3. **Unreliable delivery** — No SLO tracking or automatic unhealthy endpoint detection
4. **Poor customer experience** — Subscribers cannot self-serve on delivery status
5. **Manual toil** — Recovery requires database queries and manual intervention

**Impact:** 100% of webhook subscribers affected by each delivery incident; MTTR > 2 hours

---

## Solution Overview

Phased implementation across 5 tracks to deliver production-grade webhook reliability:

### Track 1: Metrics & Observability (3 days)
- Per-endpoint latency metrics (p50/p95/p99)
- Real-time queue depth tracking
- Automated health status updates
- Foundation for all downstream features

### Track 2: DLQ Management (3 days)
- Automatic failure reason categorization
- Filtered replay mechanism (by endpoint/reason/date)
- Alerting on backlog thresholds
- Audit trail for compliance

### Track 3: Reliability (4 days)
- Circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints
- SLO tracking (99.5% target)
- Slow endpoint detection (p99 > 5s)
- Automatic recovery windows

### Track 4: Customer Visibility (3 days)
- Per-subscription delivery status API
- Webhook test endpoint
- Analytics with success rates & latencies
- Delivery history retention

### Track 5: Documentation (2 days)
- Operational runbook with troubleshooting
- Customer integration guide
- SLO definition & measurement
- Circuit breaker behavior explanation

## Key Features

### 1. Delivery Dashboard (Operator View)
```
Endpoint: https://webhook.example.com
├─ Status: Healthy (99.7% SLO met)
├─ Pending: 3 webhooks
├─ P50 Latency: 120ms
├─ P95 Latency: 450ms
├─ P99 Latency: 950ms
├─ Success Rate: 99.7% (24h)
└─ Last Delivery: 2m ago
```

### 2. DLQ Recovery
```bash
# Replay all failures from past 24 hours
POST /v1/admin/webhooks/dlq/replay
{
  "created_after": "2026-07-27T14:00:00Z",
  "created_before": "2026-07-28T14:00:00Z",
  "limit": 5000
}
→ { "replayed_count": 142 }

# Replay specific failure type
POST /v1/admin/webhooks/dlq/replay
{
  "failure_reason": "connection_timeout",
  "limit": 1000
}
→ { "replayed_count": 47 }
```

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
```
Closed (Normal)
  ↓ (5 consecutive failures)
Open (Reject requests for 60s)
  ↓ (After 60s timeout)
Half-Open (Allow 1 test request)
  ↓ (Success) OR ↓ (Failure)
Closed                  Open (restart timer)
```

### 4. Customer Self-Service
```json
GET /v1/webhooks/{subscription_id}/status
{
  "subscription_id": "sub-123",
  "endpoint_url": "https://api.customer.com/webhook",
  "status": "active",
  "pending_count": 5,
  "success_rate_percent": 99.8,
  "avg_latency_ms": 185.5,
  "p95_latency_ms": 450.0,
  "p99_latency_ms": 950.0,
  "last_delivery_at": "2026-07-28T14:05:32Z",
  "slo_met": true,
  "recent_failures": [...]
}
```

## Database Additions

| Table | Purpose | Size |
|-------|---------|------|
| `webhook_endpoint_metrics` | Hourly delivery metrics | ~1MB/1k endpoints |
| `dlq_analysis` | Failure pattern tracking | ~10KB |
| `circuit_breaker_events` | Circuit breaker audit | ~100KB |
| `webhook_trace_log` | Per-delivery trace | ~50MB (90-day retention) |
| `subscription_analytics_hourly` | Customer analytics | ~5MB |

**Total DDL additions:** ~150 lines SQL
**New Indexes:** 8
**Maintenance cost:** ~500ms/hour aggregation

## Implementation Effort

| Phase | Days | Complexity | Risk |
|-------|------|-----------|------|
| 1. Metrics | 3 | Low | Low |
| 2. DLQ | 3 | Low | Low |
| 3. Reliability | 4 | Medium | Medium |
| 4. Customer Features | 3 | Low | Low |
| 5. Documentation | 2 | Low | Low |
| **Total** | **15** | **Medium** | **Low** |

**Recommendation:** Run as single 2-week sprint with parallel workstreams

## Success Metrics

### Operational
- **MTTR improved 50%+** — From 2h to <1h via dashboard visibility
- **DLQ resolution time < 1h** — Automated analysis + replay
- **Zero cascading failures** — Circuit breaker prevents slow endpoint damage
- **SLO >= 99.5%** — Demonstrable, measurable, reportable

### Technical
- **Delivery metrics < 100ms p99** — Sub-second observability
- **Replay mechanism 10k events < 10s** — Fast recovery
- **Aggregator < 500ms overhead** — Minimal performance impact
- **100% test coverage** — Critical path fully validated

### Business
- **Customer trust** — Transparency on delivery status
- **Reduced incidents** — Fewer escalations from webhook issues
- **SLA compliance** — Evidence of 99.5%+ uptime
- **Scale ready** — Supports 100k+ endpoints

---

## Rollout Plan

### Week 1: Infrastructure
- Deploy metrics aggregator (read-only, non-blocking)
- Create dashboard data endpoints
- Verify no performance regression

### Week 2: Operations
- Deploy DLQ analysis + replay
- Deploy circuit breaker (behind feature flag)
- Train ops team

### Week 3: Customer Features + Documentation
- Deploy customer visibility endpoints
- Publish runbook + integration guide
- Enable by default
- Communicate to customers

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **Metrics query overload** | Aggregate hourly, cache results, index by (endpoint, time) |
| **DLQ replay floods slow endpoints** | Replay rate limited, manual approval for >1000 |
| **Circuit breaker too aggressive** | Tunable thresholds, half-open test, verbose logging |
| **High-cardinality metrics** | Label limits, aggregate by domain not full URL |
| **Database storage growth** | 90-day retention policy, automated cleanup |

---

## Compliance & Security

✅ **SSRF Protection** — All URLs validated before delivery
✅ **Idempotency** — Replay mechanism repeats safely
✅ **Audit Trail** — All replay actions logged
✅ **Data Retention** — Configurable 90-day cleanup
✅ **Access Control** — Admin-only DLQ access
✅ **Rate Limiting** — Per-endpoint rate limiting enforced

---

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required
- PostgreSQL 12+ with window functions
- Prometheus metrics exporter
- Tokio async runtime (already present)

### Recommended
- Grafana for dashboard visualization
- Alertmanager for DLQ alerts
- PagerDuty integration for escalation

---

## Estimated Cost

- **Development:** 15 days engineer time (~$15k)
- **Infrastructure:** Negligible (existing DB/metrics)
- **Operational:** -$5k/month (reduced MTTR toil)
- **Net:** -$20k/month over 6 months (ROI breakdown)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Approve specification** — Confirm scope and success criteria
2. **Assign team** — 1 engineer + 0.5 QA for validation
3. **Create sprint** — 2-week implementation cycle
4. **Schedule reviews** — Code, security, performance gates
5. **Plan communication** — Customer announcement for week 3

## Questions & Decisions Required

1. **SLO Target:** Confirm 99.5% is acceptable (vs 99.9%)?
2. **Retention:** 90-day trace log retention OK, or need longer?
3. **Circuit Breaker:** 5-failure threshold, 60s recovery OK?
4. **Replay Limits:** Manual approval for >1000 items acceptable?
5. **Timeline:** Can run as single sprint, or need phased rollout?

**Recommendation to stakeholders:** Approve spec as-is. Minimal risk, high ROI, addresses critical operational need.
